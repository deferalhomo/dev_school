## My process

This took me a bit of time, and a couple of attemps.

On the final attempt that led to this semi-successful output, I started off with navigation - both desktop and mobile. I really wanted to understand how to build the hamburger nav with HTML, CSS and JS.

Afterwards I structured the main sections. Building out HTML was pretty straightforward, although I had to go back and forth between CSS and HTML to add/or remove unnecessary classes.

Navigation is defnitely a stronger element in this challenge as I closely followed a tutorial linked in the last section.

Definitelt eye-balling a lot of measurements and using percentages.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JS
- Mobile-first workflow (sort-off)

### What I learned

I learned how to create a hamburger nav with CSS/JS. Definitely will take a few more projects to nail it.

### Continued development

Still struggling to understand how to use flexbox elements and make them responsive in the way I want them to appear, failing to fully comprehend widths/heights of flex items and how values are inherited. This is a goal for the next project.
